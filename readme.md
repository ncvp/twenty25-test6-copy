# Twenty Twenty-Five test6 copy

This repo consists of a Twenty Twenty-Five child theme, twenty25-test6, which includes an immplementation of the Twenty Seventeen menu system.

## Purpose

My sites typically have 50 - 100 pages, almost entirely text. Each page is linked to a node in the header menu, which is typically 4 levels deep, but has no conceptual limit. Twenty Seventeen handles this sort of menu well, but Twenty Twenty-Five's mobile menu is rather limited. It shows the whole page tree.

## Use

1. Install the Twenty Twenty-Five theme
2. Install and activate this theme
3. Create a classic menu, if necessary, and assign it to the 'Header menu location' menu location
